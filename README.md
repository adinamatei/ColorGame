# Color Game

 For this project I used my [Webpack Boilerplate](https://github.com/adinamatei/webpackBoilerplate). I hope you'll like this simple Color Guessing Game in JavaScript.

## How to play
- Click the square that matches the RGB color described in the header
- If you guess, all squares will change their color to the guessed color; otherwise, the clicked square will disappear
- Start a new game by clicking the New Colors button
- Set difficulty to **Easy**, and play with 3 squares, or **Hard**, to play with 6 squares

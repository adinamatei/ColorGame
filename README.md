# Color Game

 For this project I used my Webpack Boilerplate and represinte a simple Color Game Guessing made with JavaScript.

 * How to play
- Find the square with the RGB color described above and click on it
- If you guess, the color of all squares it changes in guessed color; otherwise, the clicked square it disappear
- With the New Colors button you can reset the colors
- With **Easy** and **Hard** buttons you can choose the mode how to play; on easy mode you play with 3 squares and on hard mode (the default mode) you play with 6 squares

Have fun!
